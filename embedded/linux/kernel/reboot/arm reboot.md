/*
 * Restart requires that the secondary CPUs stop performing any activity
 * while the primary CPU resets the system. Systems with a single CPU can
 * use soft_restart() as their machine descriptor's .restart hook, since that
 * will cause the only available CPU to reset. Systems with multiple CPUs must
 * provide a HW restart implementation, to ensure that all CPUs reset at once.
 * This is required so that any code running after reset on the primary CPU
 * doesn't have to co-ordinate with other CPUs to ensure they aren't still
 * executing pre-reset code, and using RAM that the primary CPU's code wishes
 * to use. Implementing such co-ordination would be essentially impossible.
