 * platform_match - bind platform device to platform driver.
 * @dev: device.
 * @drv: driver.
 *
 * Platform device IDs are assumed to be encoded like this:
 * "<name><instance>", where <name> is a short description of the type of
 * device, like "pci" or "floppy", and <instance> is the enumerated
 * instance of the device, like '0' or '42'.  Driver IDs are simply
 * "<name>".  So, extract the <name> from the platform_device structure,
 * and compare it against the name of the driver. Return whether they match
 * or not.
